The thing I love most about social media feeds is the immediacy of capturing and sharing thoughts and ideas. Writing on my blog, being built with Jekyll, creates _just_ enough friction for me to overthink what I'm sharing.

Inspired by Julia Evans's [TIL blog](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/11/09/new-microblog/) implementation, I'm hoping a dedicated page and a rake task removes enough friction for me to share more often.
