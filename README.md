I work at @Zendesk as a Senior Engineer on the Ruby Platform Core team. In my day-to-day, my team and I develop and operate one of the largest-scale ecosystems of Ruby services and gems.

Outside of my work, I enjoy exploring my interests in a wide range of topics. From programming for the web to designing and building electronics, from 3D-printing to open source data science, I share my experiments and discoveries here on Github and on my [blog](https://thomascountz.com).

My research has three purposes: to make, to learn, and to share.
