I work at Zendesk as a Senior Engineer and Tech Lead on the Ruby Platform Core team, overseeing the infrastructure that powers Ruby and Rails across our products and services.

On this blog, I write about anything that piques my interestâ€”building web applications, tinkering with electronics, experimenting with 3-D printing, or exploring open-source data science.

My career is guided by three principles: to create, to learn, and to share.
