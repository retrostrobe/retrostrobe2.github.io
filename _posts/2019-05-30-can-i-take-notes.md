When I need to onboard onto a new client, or even just a new project within the same client, I want to absorb as much as I can, as quickly as I can.

This week, my mentor at 8th Light suggested that I experiment with asking to be included in as much as possible. If I have any trepidation about my role, I show up as the note-taker.

Combining this with having conversations in the [Public Square]({% post_url /2019-05-29-public-square %}) is all in the effort to bring transparency and efficiency to the way our clients communicate.
