Innocent applications don't lead to successful startups, they don't aim to go viral, or even replace something that already works well. Instead, they act as hotbeds for curiosity, discovery, and conversation around engineering, design, and product. Rather than being driven by profit, innocent applications are built to be useful, sustainable, and delightful for both the users and developers.

This concept aligns closely with Ind.ie's [Ethical Design Manifesto](https://2017.ind.ie/ethical-design/) and it's core tenets of Human Rights, Human Effort, and Human Experience.
